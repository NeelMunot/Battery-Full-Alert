# Battery Monitor

A Windows application developed through AI pair programming with GitHub Copilot to prevent battery overcharging.

## Project Background

This project was born from a personal need to protect my laptop's battery life by preventing overcharging. The entire application was developed through conversational programming with GitHub Copilot, demonstrating the power of AI-assisted development.

### Development Journey
1. Initial concept discussion with Copilot
2. Step-by-step feature implementation through prompts
3. Iterative improvements and bug fixes
4. Final packaging into executable

## Features

- 🔋 Customizable battery threshold alerts (10-100%)
- 🔊 Custom sound alerts with file persistence
- 🔔 Windows system notifications
- 💻 System tray integration
- ⚙️ Persistent settings across sessions
- 🎯 User-friendly interface

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Python 3.x
- Required packages (automatically installed through requirements.txt):
  - psutil
  - win10toast
  - pygame
  - pystray
  - Pillow
  - pyinstaller (for creating executable)

## Installation

### From Source
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/battery-monitor.git
cd battery-monitor
```

2. Create virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Creating Executable
1. Install PyInstaller if not already installed:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

2. Create executable:
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole battery_monitoring.py
```

3. Find the executable in the dist folder

## Usage

### Running from Source
```bash
python battery_monitoring.py
```

### Running Executable
1. Navigate to dist folder
2. Run `battery_monitoring.exe`

### Features Usage
1. Set desired battery threshold using slider or input box
2. Choose between default or custom alert sound
3. Click "Start Monitoring"
4. Application minimizes to system tray
5. Receive alerts when battery reaches threshold

## Development with GitHub Copilot

This project showcases how modern development can be accelerated using AI pair programming. Every feature was implemented through natural language prompts to GitHub Copilot:

1. Basic UI implementation
2. Battery monitoring logic
3. Sound alert system
4. System tray integration
5. Settings persistence
6. Executable creation
